The Queue (FIFO: First-In, First-Out)

Think of a line at a cinema. First person in is the first person out.

    Key Operations: enqueue(x), dequeue(), front(). All are O(1).

    Circular Queue (Exam Favorite): Avoids wasting space in an array.

        Formula for next position: (i + 1) % size.

        Full condition: (rear + 1) % size == front.
