1. The Stack (LIFO: Last-In, First-Out)

Think of a stack of plates. You add to the top, and you take from the top.

    Key Operations: push(x), pop(), top(), isEmpty(). All are O(1).

    Implementation: * Array: Uses a top index. If top == size-1, it's Overflow.

        Linked List: Push/Pop at the Head to keep it O(1).
The "Master Trick": Monotonic Stack

This is used for "Next Greater Element" (NGE).

Logic:

    Traverse array from Right to Left.

    While stack.top() <= current_element, Pop. (Small elements are useless).

    NGE is stack.top() (or -1 if empty).

    Push current element.
